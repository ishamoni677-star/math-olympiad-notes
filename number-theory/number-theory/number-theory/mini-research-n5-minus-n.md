# A Small Exploration on n^5 − n

## Introduction
In olympiad number theory, expressions of the form n^k − n
often appear in divisibility problems.
This note explores patterns of the expression n^5 − n
modulo small integers.

## Observation 1
For several integer values of n, we observe that
n^5 − n is divisible by 5.

This suggests a general pattern that may hold
for all integers n.

## Observation 2
We also test the expression modulo 2 and 3.

- n^5 − n is always even.
- n^5 − n is divisible by 3 for all integers n.

## Reasoning
These patterns arise due to properties of modular arithmetic
and the fact that powers repeat modulo small integers.

## Conclusion
The expression n^5 − n exhibits strong divisibility properties
for small moduli.
Such patterns motivate further generalization
for expressions of the form n^k − n.
