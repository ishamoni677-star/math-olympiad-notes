# Olympiad Problem – Divisibility

## Problem
Prove that for any integer n, the number n^5 − n is divisible by 5.

## Solution
We factor the expression:
n^5 − n = n(n − 1)(n + 1)(n^2 + 1).

Among any three consecutive integers
(n − 1), n, (n + 1),
one must be divisible by 5 when considered modulo 5.

Hence, the product is divisible by 5.

Therefore, n^5 − n is divisible by 5 for all integers n.

## Key Idea
Use modular arithmetic and factorization to reduce
the problem to simple divisibility.
